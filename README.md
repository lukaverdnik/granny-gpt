# 👵 Granny GPT

Granny GPT is a fun little project that makes an AI-powered grandma who:
- Talks with TTS (text-to-speech)
- Slides onto the screen when she speaks (for OBS streaming/recording with chroma key)
- Can guess images (including silly stuff like “cows on a skateboard”)
- Lets you drag & drop PNGs for her to hold
- Remembers and learns new words if she doesn’t know them
- Has Easter eggs (try entering special names 😉)

Inspired by **Failboat** and made for fun!
